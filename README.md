**### **Who I Am****
</h3>

My journey into programming didn’t start with <code>passion</code>. it started with <code>FEAR</code>.
I was genuinely scared of code. I didn’t think I could ever understand it. But one day, I decided to <code>face that fear head on</code> just to see if it was really as scary as I thought.
And guess what? I <code>fell in love with it.</code>
Before stepping into code, I used to work in **graphic design and animation**. That creative background sparked an idea:

**"What if I could mix my love for visual design with the logic of programming?"**

That’s how I found my way into <code>**frontend development**</code> a space where I can blend **creativity**, **motion**, and **code** into beautiful and engaging web experiences.
Today, with 5+ years of experience, I specialize in building interactive UIs, adding thoughtful animations, and always learning something new along the way.
I turned fear into passion. And now I turn ideas into experiences.
